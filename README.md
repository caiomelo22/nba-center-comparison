# NBA Center Comparison
Jupyter Notebook made with the purpose of comparing some of the NBA best players: Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic.

In this project, we try to visualize the data behind these 3 amazing players, displaying the mean of the stats in the 2021 season and in the last 10 games. Besides that, we also show a scatterplot of the player's matches, so that we can visualize the correlation between the points made by the players and their field goal percentages.
